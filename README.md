A Markov Distinction


In your repo, you should have a README file (readable by GitHub) that contains your system documentation.  You might have noticed that GitHub encourages you to use Markdown (i.e., a README.md) file - this will work perfectly.

In addition to describing how to set up and run the code, the documentation should include a title for your system and a description of your work.

You should also:

Describe how the system is personally meaningful to you (at least 1 paragraph).
Explain how working on it genuinely challenged you as a computer scientist (at least 1 paragraph).
How did you push yourself outside of your comfort zone?
Why was this an important challenge for you?
What are the next steps for you going forward?
Include a discussion of whether you believe your system is creative (and why or why not).
Make sure to credit your sources, including your colleagues if you sought their advice.
Examples
Your examples subfolder should contain 5 example works that were generated by your code.  For instance, if you were the creator of Garkov, you would include 5 comic strips that had been generated by your code.
